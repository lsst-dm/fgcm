FGCM Cookbook
=============

This is a simple cookbook/example for running FGCM on the HSC RC dataset on the
lsst-dev server.  Please see [the FGCM README](../README.md) for general installation
instructions.

Requirements
------------

This cookbook assumes access to
[lsst-dev](https://developer.lsst.io/services/lsst-dev.html) and the existence
of the HSC RC dataset from PDR1.  This is regularly reprocessed, starting with
[DM-10404](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-10404).  On `lsst-dev` the
recent reprocessing can be listed at `/datasets/hsc/repo/rerun/RC/`.  However,
I do recommend checking any relevant tickets to confirm that the most
recent processing actually has been completed.

Setup
-----

The environment should be set up as follows:

```
setup lsst_distrib

export RCRERUN=RC/v20_0_0_rc1/DM-25349-sfm
export COOKBOOKRERUN=fgcm_cookbook_v20_0_0_rc1
```

The `RCRERUN` env variable should be set to the most recent completed rerun
(see above).  The `COOKBOOKRERUN` env variable can be set to something
different if you have already run the cookbook with an older version of the
code and don't want to delete the previous run.

Finally, there is the expectation below that the `USER` environment variable is
set to your username (bash default), and that your private rerun directory is
`/datasets/hsc/repo/rerun/private/${USER}`.


Running FGCM
------------

There are four stages to running an FGCM calibration on a dataset:

1. Construct an atmosphere and instrument look-up table (LUT)
2. Ingest and match individual star observations from visit/ccd sets
3. Run the calibration for 3-4 "fit cycles", each of which contains 25-100 fit
iterations.
4. One more task will output the per-visit atmospheres for use downstream.

## Constructing a Look-Up Table (LUT)

The LUT is constructed via the `fgcmMakeLut.py` command line task.
If you are satisfied with the defaults for your telescope, you can use a
precomputed atmosphere table.  If you are not, you either need to install MODTRAN4 (not
free, unfortunately), or contact erykoff@stanford.edu.

The LUT depends on both the atmosphere parameters (which can be precomputed
generically), and the instrumental parameters (which will change as better
metrology becomes available, filters are replaced, etc).  (Though hopefully
filters aren't replaced that often.)

### Constructing a LUT from a precomputed atmosphere table

A [sample config](fgcmMakeLutHscFromTable.py) for HSC in in the `cookbook/`
directory.  There are only 3 fields to know about.  `physicalFilters` is a list
of the physical filter labels to make the LUT.  Multiple physical filters can
reference a single band (for example, HSC-R and HSC-R2 both refer to the same
r-band).  All filters that map to a single band will be calibrated together and
put on the same system.  The `stdPhysicalFilterOverrideMap` dictionary field
is the override mapping from physical filter labels to "standard" physical
filter labels.  The "standard" physical filter defines the transmission curve
that the FGCM standard bandpass will be based on.  Any filter not listed here
will be mapped to itself (e.g. HSC-G->HSC-G).  Use this override for cross-
filter calibration such as HSC-R->HSC-R2 and HSC-I->HSC-I2.  Note that at the
current time the RC2 dataset on `lsst-devl` does not contain any HSC-R2 or
HSC-I2 data.  Finally, `atmosphereTableName` specifies the name of the table
distributed with the third-party FGCM code; see that code for details.

### Constructing a LUT using MODTRAN4

A [sample config](fgcmMakeLutHscFromModtran.py) for HSC is also in
the `cookbook/` directory.  This allows you to specify the range of atmosphere
parameters in the table (pressure, water vapor, ozone, aerosol tau and alpha,
and airmass) as well as the "standard atmosphere" parameters which should be
representative of the "typical" conditions.  It is not my expectation that this
will be run very often, as it will be more convenient to decide on parameters
and compute the atmosphere table once.

### Running `fgcmMakeLut.py`

This is a very simple command-line task (assuming that your username is in the
environment variable ${USER}).  This task should take around 3.5 hours on
`lsst-dev01`.  The recommended command is:

```bash
fgcmMakeLut.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
${RCRERUN}:private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/lut --configfile \
$FGCMCAL_DIR/cookbook/fgcmMakeLutHscFromTable.py
```

## Ingesting and Matching Star Observations

In order to make the fit cycles tractable without redoing processor-intensive
steps, all data are collated and star observations are matched and indexed
before the fit runs are started.  Depending on how many visits are being
processed, and where the data are located, this step can take quite a while.
With the addition of the `sourceTable_visit` parquet files which consolidate
all the ccds for each visit into one easy-to-read file, this step has gotten a
lot faster.

The FGCM code runs on `sourceTable_visit` catalogs constrained by the `--id`
parameter on the command line.  For config settings, please see the [sample
config](fgcmBuildStarsTableHsc.py).

If `doReferenceCalibration = True` in the configuration (the default), then
stars from a reference catalog (e.g. PS1) will be loaded and matched to the
internal stars.  The signal-to-noise cut specified here should be the minimum
one expects to use in the actual fit, and the fit may also be performed without
the use of reference stars if desired.

### Running `fgcmBuildStarsTable.py`

This is also a simple command-line task.  This task will take around 20 minutes
on `lsst-dev01`:

```bash
fgcmBuildStarsTable.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/lut:private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/wide+deep+udeep \
--configfile $FGCMCAL_DIR/cookbook/fgcmBuildStarsTableHsc.py \
--id filter=HSC-G^HSC-R^HSC-I^HSC-Z^HSC-Y
```

## Running a Fit Cycle

### The First Fit Cycle (Cycle 0)

See the [sample config](fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle00_config.py) for a sample
config file.  In this config is a place to describe the observational epochs
(divided by MJD) which should correspond to changes in observing (years, camera
warm-ups, etc), preferably coordinated with when new flat-fields were
generated.  At the moment flats are regenerated for HSC every couple of weeks
which is too frequent for a good fit from FGCM.  This is being
investigated. There is also a place to describe when the mirror was washed or
recoated (in MJD), as the system throughput usually jumps at these times.

There are three important differences between the first fit cycle ("cycle 0")
and subsequent cycles.  The first is that a "bright observation" algorithm is
employed in the first cycle to choose approximately photometric observations,
while for subsequent iterations the best fit parameters from the previous
iterations are used to determine photometric observations.  The second is that
it is recommended that you freeze the atmosphere to the "standard parameters"
for the first fit cycle (the default).  The third is that for HSC it can be
useful to set `precomputeSuperStarInitialCycle` which can build a "super-star
flat" based on the bright observation selection to smooth out the large
illumination correction term.

At the end of the first (and all subsequent) cycles a whole bunch of diagnostic
plots are made in a subdirectory of the current directory where you invoked the
FGCM fit.  Therefore, you should run in a clean directory.  The directory name
and plot filenames are generated from the `outfileBase` and the `cycleNumber`.
Finally, a new config file is output for the next fit cycle that automatically
increments the `cycleNumber` and turns off `freezeStdAtmosphere`.

When running the output is logged to stdout, though it's useful to capture the
output into a file with `tee`.  Note that if you want to start a new fit with
different parameters with the same stars/LUT then you can simply specify a new
output rerun and go from there.  This stage should take less than 5 minutes to
run on `lsst-dev01`.

```bash
fgcmFitCycle.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/wide+deep+udeep:private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile $FGCMCAL_DIR/cookbook/fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle00_config.py \
|& tee fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle00.log
```

### Subsequent Fit Cycles

Before running subsequent fit cycles, it is helpful to look at the diagnostic
plots.  The most important plots are `cycleNUMBER_expgray_BAND.png` plots.  As
of [DM-17305](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-17305), the width of these
histograms are used to set a default photometricity cut for the next fit
cycle.  However, it is worth inspecting these histograms to ensure that they
look "normal".  The expectation is that they have a Gaussian core with an
excess non-photometric tail out to the negative side.  Any significant
bi-modality is a sign that something has gone horribly awry with the fits,
perhaps indicating issues with the input data or the configuration parameters.

The relevant configuration parameters that you might want to adjust based on
these plots are `expGrayPhotometricCut` (on the negative side) and
`expGrayHighCut` (on the positive side).  You want to capture the core and
reject outliers, but not too tight that you lose a lot of visits and can't
constrain the fit.

You can also increase the number of iterations per fit cycle.  In my
experience, the fit does not improve if you go beyond ~50 iterations with small
datasets, but large datasets can use ~100 iterations per cycle.

```bash
fgcmFitCycle.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle01_config.py |& tee \
fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle01.log
```

```bash
fgcmFitCycle.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle02_config.py |& tee \
fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle02.log
```

```bash
fgcmFitCycle.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle03_config.py |& tee \
fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle03.log
```

### Final fit cycle

After the user has concluded that the fit has converged to her satisfaction,
one last run should be made with `isFinalCycle=True`.  This will tell `fgcm` to
run one final selection of stars and photometric exposures, and will output
zeropoints and standard stars for use in `fgcmOutputProducts.py`.  Running the
final cycle ensures that the final products have consistently applied
selections, superstar flats, and internal aperture corrections.  The final
cycle run should only take 2-3 minutes.

```bash
fgcmFitCycle.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle04_config.py \
--config isFinalCycle=True |& tee \
fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_cycle04.log
```

## Outputs

The FGCM fitter spits out a number of outputs.  The first set is the diagnostic
plots which are put in a subdirectory of the current directory where the
command-line task is run.  The second set is the data products with zeropoint
and atmosphere information that is stored in the output repository.

### Diagnostic Plots

There are a wide range of diagnostic plots that get output.  This is a brief
explanation of what's in each one.  For details on how quantities are computed,
please see the [FGCM paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155...41B).

## Outputs and Data Products

FGCM has both internal data products that are produced for each fit cycle, as
well as the ability to output photometric calibration data in a way that can be
used by downstream processing in the stack.

### Making Stack Output Products

The final task can output atmosphere transmission curves derived from the model
fit for each visit (`doAtmosphereOutput'); output a reference catalog of
"standard stars" that may be used for single-ccd calibration
(`doRefcatOutput`); and `fgcm_photoCalib` files for each visit/ccd
(`doZeropointOutput`).  All of these options are on by default.

The FGCM calibration can be run with or without reference stars as an anchor.
The new default, including in this cookbook, is to run with reference sources
from PS1.  However, if you run without reference sources you get a good
relative calibraiton but the overall throughput for each band is
unconstrained.  To get the output reference catalog and zeropoints on a
physical scale, we must use calspec standards (which is preferred, but not
currently supported) or a reference catalog such as PS1.  To turn on this final
computation of the system throughput, set `doReferenceCalibration=True` in the
`FgcmOutputProducts` task.  (The default is now `False`).  Please see the [sample
config](fgcmOutputProductsHsc.py) for example usage of setting up the reference
catalog.

To build the output products you use the `fgcmOutputProducts.py` command-line
task.  The only config variable is the cycle number that the user has deemed to
be converged and should be output.  This should take around 5 minutes on `lsst-dev01`.

```bash
fgcmOutputProducts.py /datasets/hsc/repo --rerun \
private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1 \
--configfile $FGCMCAL_DIR/cookbook/fgcmOutputProductsHsc.py \
--config cycleNumber=4 |& tee fgcmFitCycleHscCookbook_output.log
```

In the output repo
`/datasets/hsc/repo/rerun/private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1/transmission/` you will now
find a whole bunch of `atmosphere_VISIT.fits` files of the
`lsst.afw.image.TransmissionCurve` type.  Note that even if you have frozen the
atmosphere parameters to the "standard" values, these will be computed
specifically for the airmass of each individual observation.

In the output repo
`/datasets/hsc/repo/rerun/private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1/ref_cats/fgcm_stars/'
you will find a sharded reference catalog suitable to use for any observations
overlapping the survey images that have been calibrated.

And in the output repo
`/datasets/hsc/repo/rerun/private/${USER}/${COOKBOOKRERUN}/fit1/fgcmcal-results`
you will find all of the `fgcmcal_photoCalib` spatially-variable zeropoint
files that can be used in coaddition.  At the moment, these combine information
from the WCS Jacobian distortions as well as the spatially variable
transmission (due to the illumination correction derived by FGCM).  In the
future, the Jacobian information will be factored out.

### FGCM-Specific Data Products

The data products that may be of use to the end user, and grabbed from the butler,
e.g.:

```python
zeropoints = butler.get('fgcmZeropoints', dataId={'fgcmcycle': last_cycle_run})
```

* `fgcmZeropoints-%(fgcmcycle)02d.fits`: Table of zeropoints (`FGCM_ZPT`) and
  first-order chromatic corrections (`FGCM_I10`) per visit/ccd.  Quality of
  exposure is given by `FGCM_FLAG`, see FGCM paper for details.
* `fgcmAtmosphereParameters-%(fgcmcycle)02d.fits`: Atmosphere model parameters
  (per visit) that can be used as input to MODTRAN or `fgcm` to generate atmosphere
  transmission.
* Other data products are used as an input to the next fit cycle.
